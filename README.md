## About

This repo contains an agent to play Hanabi card game builded for the course Computational Intelligence at Politecnico di Torino.

There are different type of bots that can be used. Our suggestion is to select **Nexto**, because of its general better performance. To access result for all types of bot look into *Results.md*.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.0

- Numpy

- Scipy

## Usage

Simply run `server.py` and then run `client.py` with the requested arguments.

Client Arguments:

- --host: server ip

- --port: server listening port

- --player_name: name of the player

- --bot: type of bot to use (Poirot, Canaan, Nexto)

- --evolve: use this to tune parameters

- --epochs: number of games to play

To make life easier you can simply run `starter.ps1` and change here the parameters.
